## A Website The Features Myself

This application contains links to all of the most recent software engineering projects that I've been working on to improve as a software engineer. In addition, it contains an About section, a Contact section, a list of relevant software engineering skills that I possess, and a link to all of my socials.

## Purpose of this Project

This website represents a lot of what I've learned while studying to become a Software Engineer. Thanks to the help of a friend, I was able to create something that looks good while being fundamentally different from other websites.

### Thank you for viewing my Web Portfolio!
